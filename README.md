### Project Description
This is a quirky, sarcastic web application that lets users waste time while popping virtual bubbles, breaking fortune cookies with roasty or motivational messages, and getting arbitrary yes/no answers to random questions. Each activity has its own set of humorous achievements to unlock.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
For those who don’t waste enough time online, there’s a serious lack of useless projects to fill this critical void.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing a time-wasting suite of distractions! Bubble popping, sarcastic fortune cookies, vague yes/no answers, and achievements that roast you along the way.
